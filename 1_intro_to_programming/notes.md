# Introduction to the programming

### History of computer

- computer used to be very big earlier days like size of a big room
- they invented for the calculation purpose.....addition/subtration
- invention on transister was a major breakthrough in computer
- computer on understand binary number that is 0 and 1.
- A transistor in a computer is a tiny electronic switch that can turn on (1) or off (0).It controls the flow of electricity.Billions of them inside processors form logic gates and circuits.These switches working together let computers do calculations, store data, and run programs.
- Machine Code (1940s) → The very first programs were written in raw binary (0s and 1s).
- Assembly Language (1947–49) → A human-readable version of machine code (using mnemonics like MOV, ADD).

- High-Level Language:

1. Plankalkül (1940s, by Konrad Zuse) → Considered the first high-level programming language, but not widely used.
2. FORTRAN (1957, by IBM) → The first widely adopted high-level programming language.

## 🧮 Pre-Computer Era (Conceptual Foundations)

- **1830s – Charles Babbage (Analytical Engine)**  
  Considered the "father of the computer". Designed a mechanical general-purpose computer that introduced concepts like memory, arithmetic logic unit, and control flow.
- **1842–43 – Ada Lovelace (First Programmer)**  
  Wrote the first algorithm for Babbage’s Analytical Engine, making her the world’s first programmer. She foresaw the potential of computers beyond number-crunching.

## ⚡ Early Computers (1930s–1940s)

- **1936 – Alan Turing (Turing Machine)**  
  Introduced the idea of a theoretical machine that could simulate any algorithm → foundation of theoretical computer science and algorithms.
- **1941 – Konrad Zuse (Z3)**  
  Built the Z3, world’s first programmable digital computer using electromechanical relays.
- **1945 – ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)**  
  First general-purpose electronic digital computer, used for military calculations (US Army).
- **1947 – Transistor Invention (Bell Labs)**  
  Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain invented the transistor → replaced bulky vacuum tubes, enabling smaller and faster computers.

## 💻 Programming Languages Evolution

- **1940s – Machine Code & Assembly**  
  Programs written in binary (0s and 1s). Assembly introduced mnemonics like `MOV`, `ADD` to make it slightly human-readable.
- **1945 – Plankalkül (Konrad Zuse)**  
  First high-level programming language, but not implemented widely.
- **1957 – FORTRAN (IBM)**  
  "Formula Translation" language for scientific computing. First widely adopted high-level language.
- **1959 – COBOL**  
  Designed for business computing, standardized data processing.
- **1970 – Pascal**  
  Promoted structured programming and teaching of programming concepts.
- **1972 – C (Dennis Ritchie, Bell Labs)**  
  Powerful low-level control + portability → used to build UNIX OS. Still widely used.
- **1983 – C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup)**  
  Extension of C with object-oriented features.
- **1991 – Python (Guido van Rossum)**  
  Simple, readable, and versatile. Popular for web, AI, and data science.
- **1995 – Java (Sun Microsystems)**  
  “Write once, run anywhere.” Platform-independent and widely used for enterprise and Android.
- **1995 – JavaScript (Netscape)**  
  Initially for adding interactivity in browsers, now full-stack via Node.js.

## 🌐 Networking & Internet

- **1969 – ARPANET**  
  First packet-switching network, funded by the US DoD → foundation of the Internet.
- **1971 – First Email**  
  Ray Tomlinson sent the first electronic mail using ARPANET.
- **1983 – TCP/IP Protocol Standardization**  
  Became the backbone of the modern Internet.
- **1989 – World Wide Web (Tim Berners-Lee)**  
  Proposed hypertext system to share documents → foundation of the web we use today.
- **1991 – Public Web Release**  
  The Web became open for public use, transforming global communication.

## 🖥️ Modern Computing Milestones

- **1975 – Microsoft Founded (Bill Gates & Paul Allen)**  
  Started with BASIC interpreter → later became dominant with Windows OS.
- **1976 – Apple Founded (Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak)**  
  Introduced Apple I & II → personal computing revolution.
- **1981 – IBM PC Released**  
  Standardized personal computing with open architecture.
- **1984 – Macintosh (Apple)**  
  First widely sold personal computer with GUI (Graphical User Interface).
- **2007 – iPhone Launch**  
  Popularized smartphones → revolution in mobile computing and app ecosystems.
- **2010s – Cloud Computing, AI & Big Data**  
  Rise of platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP. AI advancements with deep learning.
- **2020s – Quantum Computing Research**  
  Companies like Google, IBM, and D-Wave are working on quantum processors.  
  Still experimental but promises exponential speedups for certain problems.
